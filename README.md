# Design and Structural Calculation of a Device for Epilepsy Treatment Using Magnets

## Project Description

The aim of this project is to develop a safe and efficient device for the treatment of epilepsy in a clinical setting, with appropriate dimensions for therapeutic use in pediatric patients. 

First, different material alternatives are explored, taking into account pre-established requirements such as electromagnetic compatibility and mechanical resistance.

Various models are created using SolidWorks and CatiaV5, combining both programs to achieve the best possible result for all components of this project.

The final design comprises three main components, which are subjected to magnetic and static analysis under two possible situations during hypothetical clinical use.

The end result is a design that meets all imposed requirements, with detailed construction plans provided and the entire process reflected in the budget.

## Technologies Used

- **3D Modeling**: SolidWorks, CatiaV5
